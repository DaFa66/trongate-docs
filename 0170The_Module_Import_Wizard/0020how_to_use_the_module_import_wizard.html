<div class="alert alert-danger">Never use the Module Import Wizard on a live website. For improved security it's best to carry out module imports on your 'localhost' environment and then upload once you're happy with your new module.</div>

<div class="alert alert-success">If you have a module that requires database tables, export SQL files (from your donor database) and add those (.sql) files into the new module. The activate the wizard, simply navigate to your base URL followed by the name of your new module directory.</div>
