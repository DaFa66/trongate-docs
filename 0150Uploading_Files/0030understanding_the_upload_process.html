<h1>Understanding The Upload Process<br></h1>
<p>Here is some sample code for a submit_upload() method:</p>
<p><pre><code>
function submit_upload() {
 $this-&gt;module("trongate_security"); 
 $this-&gt;trongate_security-&gt;_make_sure_allowed();

 if ($_FILES["my_file"]["name"] == "") {
  redirect($_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"]);
 }

 //PLEASE NOTE: max_size is in kilobytes
 $validation_str = "allowed_types[gif,jpg,jpeg,png,zip]|max_size[2000]";
 $this-&gt;validation_helper-&gt;set_rules("my_file", "file", $validation_str);

 $result = $this-&gt;validation_helper-&gt;run();

 if ($result == true) {

  //upload the file
  $config["destination"] = "../public/files";
  $config["make_rand_name"] = false;

  $file_info = $this-&gt;upload_file($config);

  //set some flashdata
  set_flashdata("Your file (".$file_info["file_name"].") was successfully uploaded");

  //Job done! Send the user to another page...
  $target_url = str_replace("/submit_upload", "/show", current_url());
  redirect($target_url);

 } else {
  //validation error! Present the form again.
  $this-&gt;upload();
 }
</code></pre></p>
<p>The method first calls upon the <strong>trongate_security</strong> module to ensure that the user is logged in and has a user level of 'admin'.</p>
<p><pre><code>
  $this-&gt;module("trongate_security"); 
  $this-&gt;trongate_security-&gt;_make_sure_allowed();
</code></pre></p>
<p>The method then checks if the user has selected a file to upload by checking the $_FILES array. If no file is present, it redirects the user back to the previous page.</p>
<p><pre><code>
  if ($_FILES["my_file"]["name"] == "") {
    redirect($_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"]);
  }
</code></pre></p>
<p><br>Then, the method declares validation rules for the file, by setting the validation string for "allowed_types" which could be gif,jpg,jpeg,png,zip and "max_size" is 2000 kilobytes.<br>It uses the validation helper class to perform validation tests and passes; the form field name, form field label and validation string as arguments.</p>
<p><pre><code>
  $validation_str = "allowed_types[gif,jpg,jpeg,png,zip]|max_size[2000]";
  $this-&gt;validation_helper-&gt;set_rules("my_file", "file", $validation_str);
</code></pre></p>
<p><strong>Please note that the allowed_types validation string should contain an array of allowed file types, inside square brackets, separated by commas. </strong> <br><br>If the validation passes, the method proceeds to upload the file. In doing so, it sets the destination folder to '../public/files' and makes the file name random using $config['make_rand_name'] = true;</p>
<p><pre><code>
//upload the file
$config["destination"] = "../public/files";
$config["make_rand_name"] = false;

$file_info = $this-&gt;upload_file($config);
</code></pre></p>
<p>It should be noted that the line of code below is optional:</p>
<p><pre><code>
$config["make_rand_name"] = false;
</code></pre></p>
<p>If $config['make_rand_name'] is set to <strong>false</strong> or <em>not included in the method</em> then the uploaded file will retain the original file name. On the other hand, if $config['make_rand_name'] is set to true, the uploaded file will be given a file name made of random alpha-numeric characters. <strong> Potentially dangerous or troublesome characters will be automatically removed from the file name, regardless of whether make_rand_name is set to true or false</strong>.  <br><br>The file is uploaded using the '<strong>upload_file</strong>' method, with the configuration passed to it.<br>If the file upload is successful, it sets a flashdata message and redirects the user to another page.</p>
<p>The upload_file method returns an array named, 'file_info'. The file_info array contains the following key / value pairs:</p>
<li><strong>file_name</strong> : the name of the uploaded file. For example, 'car.png'.</li>
<li><strong>file_path</strong> : the full path that indicates where the file was uploaded to.</li>
<li><strong>file_type</strong> : the type of file that was uploaded.</li>
<li><strong>file_size</strong> : the size of the uploaded file in bytes. </li>
<div class="alert alert-success">
    Since the returned file size is expressed in bytes, it may be a good idea to convert your file sizes into a value that is easier to read. For those kinds of situations, the following PHP code may be useful:</p>
    <p><pre><code>
    $file_size_in_kb = round($file_info["file_size"] / 1024, 2);
$file_size_in_mb = round($file_info["file_size"] / 1048576, 2);
$file_size_in_gb = round($file_info["file_size"] / 1073741824, 2);
    </code></pre><br><br>
</div>
</p>
<p>The code below sets a flashdata message that indicates that the file was successfully uploaded. The name of the uploaded file is also displayed by referencing the file_name property that is within the returned file_info array:</p>
<p><pre><code>
//set some flashdata
set_flashdata("Your file (".$file_info["file_name"].") was successfully uploaded");

//Job done! Send the user to another page...
$target_url = str_replace("/submit_upload", "/show", current_url());
redirect($target_url);
</code></pre><br><br>If the validation does not pass, it calls the 'upload' method to present the upload form again.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">If any of the code above looks confusing, please check out our documentation for <a href="https://trongate.io/docs_m/information/form-validation-the-pipe-method">the form validation pipe method</a>. From that page, you'll find a full explanation of how the code above works and even a video tutorial!</div>
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">When you submit a file for uploading, using PHP, a $_FILES superglobal array is created. You can view the contents of this array with either var_dump($_FILES) or json($_FILES).</div>
