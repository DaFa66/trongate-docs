<h1>Building An Uploader Form<br></h1>
<p>To create a file uploader form with the Trongate framework, we first need to build a method in a controller that will output the form. The method can be named anything, but it is generally recommended to use a name that reflects the purpose of the method, such as 'upload'. For example:</p>
<p><pre><code>
function upload() {
  $this-&gt;module("trongate_security");
  $this-&gt;trongate_security-&gt;_make_sure_allowed();
  $data["form_location"] = str_replace("/upload", "/submit_upload", current_url());
  $data["view_file"] = "upload";
  $this-&gt;template("admin", $data);
    }</code></pre></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">In OOP, a 'method' is the name given to a function that exists inside a class.</div>
</p>
<h2>Understanding The Upload Method</h2>
<p>In the example above, we're using the <strong>trongate_security</strong> module to ensure that only users with the role of 'admin' can access the uploader form. We're then declaring a form location by performing a string replace on the current URL. This means that if the form is displayed on <strong>http://localhost/demo/users/upload/88</strong>, the form location will be <strong>http://localhost/demo/users/submit_upload/88</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, we're passing an instruction to load a page containing a view file called '<strong>upload</strong>'. The view file will contain the actual form code, which is similar to an ordinary HTML form, but with two key differences:</p>
<li><strong>form_open_upload()</strong> is used to produce a form opening tag.</li>
<li><strong>form_file_select('my_file')</strong> is used to create a file uploading field.</li>
<p>The code for the view file might look something like this:</p>
<p><pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;Upload File&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose a file and then hit "Upload".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;?php
validation_errors();
echo form_open_upload($form_location);
echo form_file_select("my_file");
echo form_submit("submit", "Upload");
echo form_close();
</code></pre></p>
<p>The view file is similar to an ordinary HTML form but it uses Trongate specific functions such as 'form_open_upload()' to create the opening form tag and 'form_file_select()' to create the file input field.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">The 'my_file' argument that gets passed into the form_file_select method gives our form field a name of 'my_file'. You could, of course, use another name if you wanted to.</div>
</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot, showing our uploader form within the context of an 'admin' template:</p>
