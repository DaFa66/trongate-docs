<h1>Calling Another Module From A Controller<br></h1>
<p>With the Trongate framework, there are two mechanisms by which a module can load another module.</p>
<p>The first method is calling a module from within a <em>controller</em> file. The second is calling a module from a <em>view</em> file. Here's how to call a module from a controller file.</p>
<p><pre><code>
$this-&gt;module("module_name");
$this-&gt;module_name-&gt;do_something();
</code></pre></p>
<p>As you can see, just two lines of code is all it takes to invoke a method from a different module.</p>
<p>Below is a hypothetical example of a method that calls upon a 'tax' module to calculate a price <em>after</em> tax has been added.</p>
<p><pre><code>
function _calculate_total($price) {

  //load the "tax" module
  $this-&gt;module("tax");

  //add tax, using the "Tax" module
  $total = $this-&gt;tax-&gt;_add_tax($price);
  return $total;
}
</code></pre></p>
<p>Below is an example of a method that calls upon <em>three</em> other modules to calculate a total price. The modules being called here will be named 'tax', 'shipping' and 'discount'. So, we're imagining:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a module called 'tax' for calculating how much tax needs to be paid</li>
    <li>a 'shipping' module for calculating the cost of shipping</li>
    <li>a 'discount' module that's dedicated to applying any relevant discounts that are available</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<p><pre><code>
function _calculate_total($price) {
  $this-&gt;module("discount");
  $this-&gt;module("shipping");
  $this-&gt;module("tax");

  $price = $this-&gt;tax-&gt;_add_tax($price);
  $price = $this-&gt;shipping-&gt;_add_shipping($price);
  $total = $this-&gt;discount-&gt;_apply_discount($price);
  return $total;
}
</code></pre></p>
<div class="alert alert-success">You'll notice, in the example above, that the three modules were loaded <em>together</em>, <em>high up in the code</em> and <em>in alphabetical order</em>. Strictly speaking, this was not necessary. However, the practice of loading classes in this manner has been found to be very good for code readability and maintainability.</div>
