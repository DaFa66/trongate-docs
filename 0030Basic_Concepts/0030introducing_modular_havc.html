<h1>Introducing Modular HAVC</h1>
<p>The Trongate framework is a perfect choice for developers who are interested in building large scale web apps that are scalable, stable <em>and</em> performant. Early benchmark tests suggest that Trongate massively out-performs every other popular PHP framework in terms of page load speed. Even micro-frameworks like Lumen cannot get close to the levels of performance that Trongate has!</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">The benchmark results above were achieved using a fully-loaded version of Trongate. This means, all helper classes were instantiated, and a database connection was established at the point when page requests were being recorded.</div>

<h2>How Come Trongate Is So Fast?</h2>
<p>There are two reasons why Trongate <em>massively</em> outperforms other leading PHP frameworks. Framework makers from elsewhere, take note!</p>
<li>Trongate is the <em>only</em> framework that takes full advantage of PHP's incredible speed. Specifically, this means refraining from using PSR-4 autoloading.</li>
<li>Trongate use a unique modular architectural pattern called HAVC. This stands for Hierarchical Assets View Controller.</li>

<p>If you understand the MVC software design pattern then you'll have no difficulty in understanding HAVC. That's because HAVC is a natural progression from MVC.</p>
