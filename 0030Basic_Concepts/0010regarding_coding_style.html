<h1>Regarding Coding Style</h1>
<p>The code examples used throughout this documentation are written in the K&R (Kernighan and Ritchie) coding style.</p>
<p>The K&R style is a popular coding style, especially in C programming, as it is compact, avoids ambiguity and can save vertical space in the code. It is named after the authors of the classic book "The C Programming Language", Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics of K&R Style</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Indentation uses spaces, not tabs, promoting uniformity across various environments.</li>
    <li>Opening curly braces '{' are on the same line as the function or control statement, reducing vertical space usage.</li>
    <li>Closing curly braces '}' align with the start of the controlling statement, making blocks of code easier to identify.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p><pre><code>
function hello_world() {
  echo "hello world";
}
</code></pre></p>

<h2>Additional Coding Conventions</h2>
<p>Trongate encourages the following practices to streamline development:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using snake_case for file and directory names for consistency.</li>
    <li>Preferencing plural names to imply collections or groups.</li>
    <li>Adopting four-space characters for tabs to ensure clarity in indentation.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>Trongate provides developers with a syntax that mirrors PHP’s core characteristics, promoting familiarity and consistency. The use of snake_case, for example, aligns with PHP's own syntax, which extensively utilizes snake_case due to its roots in C programming. This design choice ensures that Trongate feels natural to PHP developers and maintains consistency with the underlying language conventions.</p>

<h2>Trongate's Approach to Namespaces and Access Modifiers</h2>
<p>Trongate simplifies development by minimizing the use of access modifiers and namespaces. This streamlined approach contrasts with the more complex conventions often found in traditional PHP frameworks and aims to accelerate development processes.</p>

<p>While adaptation to Trongate’s style is optional, many developers find that embracing this streamlined approach significantly enhances efficiency once they become accustomed to it.</p>

<h2>Modern PHP Syntax</h2>
<p>Recent versions of PHP offer developers the opportunity to incorporate advanced features such as type hinting, doc-blocks, return types, and annotations. These features can enrich code with detailed type information and metadata, enhancing clarity and robustness. However, their use remains entirely optional.</p>

<p>While Trongate fully supports these modern PHP features, they are not used in the framework's documentation. This approach is adopted to maintain simplicity and ensure that examples are accessible and easy to understand, especially for those new to the framework or to programming in general.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>PHP developers who are accustomed to using features like doc-blocks and type hinting are encouraged to continue leveraging these elements to enhance code quality and maintainability.</p>
