<h1>Code Distribution & Management</h1>
<p>As with other PHP frameworks, Trongate developers can use and share code using <a href="https://packagist.org/" target="_blank">Packagist</a>. However, the Trongate framework also offers "<a href="https://trongate.io/module-market" target="_blank">The Module Market</a>" - a dedicated platform tailored specifically for Trongate. Unlike Packagist, which serves a broad array of PHP frameworks, The Module Market focuses exclusively on Trongate modules, aiming for higher standards of integration and security. This platform streamlines module discovery and integration for Trongate developers, providing modules that must meet specific standards of quality and compatibility unique to Trongate, as enforced by the individual developers.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">All of the modules that are available from the Trongate Module Market are open source and can be downloaded and used for free.</div>

<p>The Module Market operates under a "single point of accountability" model, where a single developer is responsible for uploading and maintaining each module. This model stands in stark contrast to the community-driven approach of Packagist, where numerous contributors can modify a single package. The single point of accountability model helps ensure that each module maintains consistent quality and security standards, significantly reducing the risk of integration issues and vulnerabilities often associated with broader contributor bases. This developer-focused approach promotes stability and security in applications developed within the Trongate ecosystem, as each developer is directly accountable for their contributions.</p>
