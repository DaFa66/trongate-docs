<h1>Additional Information</h1>
<p>Trongate's File Asset Manager raises some interesting questions to do with application structure. For example, let's assume that you build a picture uploader for a 'members' module. Perhaps the picture uploader is going to give members an opportunity to add pictures onto their profile pages.</p>
<p>Some developers may be tempted to have member pictures stored inside the 'members' module. This would certainly make the application extremely modular. Nevertheless, the recommendation for that kind of scenario would be to have member pictures stored inside the <em>public</em> directory - perhaps inside a 'member_pics' directory or some other appropriately named directory.</p>
<p>Your goal should be to create modules that are reusable. So, if another client asks for a similar feature in the future then you should be able to simply copy and paste your existing 'members' module without having to dig around, manually deleting member pictures.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">If any of this has left you wondering, "Where should I store x?" or "How should I structure my app?" than that's okay! Web development is full of grey areas and it's for <em>you</em>, the developer, to make the final decision about how <em>your</em> apps are going to be structured. Don't worry!</div>
