<h1>The 'Get' Method <br> </h1>
<p>The 'Get' method is for fetching rows of data from a database table. It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>$order_by</strong> (optional) - the name of the table column by which results should be ordered. In instances where you'd like your results to be displayed in descending order, add the characters ' desc' onto your order by argument. By default, the Model will order results by 'id'.</li>
    <li><strong>$target_table</strong> (optional) - the name of the database table to be queried. By default, the Model will assume the target table to be equal to the value on the first URL segment.</li>
    <li><strong>$limit</strong> (optional) - the maximum number of results that you would like to return. By default, the Model will assume no limit.</li>
    <li><strong>$offset</strong> (optional) - the number of rows to skip before fetching results.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-warning">The starting point for a database results set is always assumed to have an offset of 0.</div>
</p>
<h2>What Gets Returned?</h2>
<p><strong>WHEN MATCHING RECORDS ARE FOUND</strong></p>
<p>If matching records are found then a PHP array will be returned where each item on the array represents a row from a database table. Each row, within the array, will be a PHP object.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN MATCHING RECORDS ARE NOT FOUND</strong></p>
<p>If the query fails to find any matching records then an empty array will be returned.</p>
<h2>Example 1 <br> </h2>
<p>The syntax below shows the simplest Get example possible. In this example, we pass no arguments in and the Model will use default values, as defined above, to generate a database query.</p>
<p><pre><code>$rows = $this-&gt;model-&gt;get();
</code></pre></p>
<p>The code above will produce the following SQL query:</p>
<p><strong>SELECT * from <em><strong>tablename</strong></em> ORDER BY id</strong></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">In a working example, 'tablename' would be replaced with the first segment from the URL.</div>
</p>
<p>Below is an example of a Members.php controller file that contains a test() method. Here we're invoking a basic 'Get' command and then immediately displaying the results using Trongate's json() method:</p>
<p><pre><code>&lt;?php
 class Members extends Trongate {
 
     function test() {
         $rows = $this-&gt;model-&gt;get();
         json($rows);
     }

</code></pre></p>
<p>Below shows an example of the kind of output that we can expect to see from the above method, when Debug Mode is switched on:</p>

<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>Below is a more advanced example: </p>
<p><pre><code>$rows = $this-&gt;model-&gt;get("trongate_user_id desc", "members", 3, 0);
</code></pre></p>
<p>The code above would produce the following SQL query:</p>
<p><strong>SELECT * FROM members order by trongate_user_id desc LIMIT 0, 3</strong></p>
