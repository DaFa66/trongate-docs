	<h1>Reasons To Use Trongate</h1>
	<h2>Reason #2 : Stability</h2>
	<p>Trongate gets improved constantly.  However, the makers of Trongate take the viewpoint that it should be possible to update and improve web development frameworks <i>without breaking them</i>.</p>
    <p>Trongate's approach differs from frameworks like Symfony - which offers paid certification that's tied to specific version numbers.   Just to state the obvious, <i>that</i> business model has given the makers of Symfony a clear financial incentive to reversion, rewrite and ultimately break their own framework <i>frequently</i>.</p>
    <p>It should come as no surprise that the PHP frameworks that come with the option paid certification are the most frequently rewritten and <i>least</i> stable frameworks of the entire PHP space.</p>
    <p>Trongate handles framework updates in a manner that is innovative and unintrusive.  The video below offers more details.</p>

    <h3>We Don't Sell Certificates!</h3>

    <p>To be clear:  Trongate will never offer paid certification because doing so would impede our top priority of ensuring the stability of the framework.</p>
