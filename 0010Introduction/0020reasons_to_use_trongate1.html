	<h1>Reasons to Use Trongate</h1>
	<h2>Reason #1: It's Fast</h2>
	<p>Trongate is fast. <i>Very</i> fast. If there's a faster PHP framework anywhere in the world, then we haven't heard of it. The secret to Trongate's speed? Low overheads.</p>
	<p>Let's take a moment to visually compare an 'out of the box' Trongate installation with a default Laravel installation.</p>
	<h3>This is Laravel</h3>
	<p>The diagram below shows how files are loaded in a basic, vanilla installation of the Laravel framework.</p>

	<p>The diagram below shows everything called in a basic installation of the Trongate framework.</p>

	<p>Since Trongate incurs far fewer overheads it should come as no surprise that Trongate is far faster. It should also be noted that the Trongate installation shown above has full database functionality and sessions enabled - along with <i>all</i> helpers, including form validation - <i>all ready for use</i>.</p>
