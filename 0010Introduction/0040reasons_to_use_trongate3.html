	<h1>Reasons to Use Trongate</h1>
	<h2>Reason #3 : No Third-Party Dependencies</h2>
	<p>Whilst the usage of third-party code can sometimes be a good thing, it should never be an integral part of any <i>core</i> web development framework.  Any framework that depends upon third-party code is subjected to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Somebody else's rewrite schedule.</li>
		<li>Somebody else's security challenges.</li>
		<li>Somebody else's vision.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Why Framework Makers Cosy Up To Third-Party Libraries</h3>
	<p>By declaring a friendly association with a third-party asset (such as JavaScript library), a framework maker gets the benefit of being able save time by using somebody else's work.  Perhaps even more importantly, however, is the reality that these types of associations often result in astonishingly effective framework promotion.</p>
	<p>A declaration that <i>"Our framework chooses Library 'x'"</i> would almost certainly result in the makers of 'Library x' telling their following about <i>your</i> framework.  This will likely be picked up and reported by other publishers of web development content.  The result is a sort of cosy cross-asset promotion with one effectively side saying:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>"Hey, all you users of Library X - you might want to check out our PHP framework because we're using what you have!"</b></li>
	</ul>
	And the other side saying,
	<ul>
		<li><b>"Hey everybody, look at how popular we've become - <i>this framework</i> has started using our code!"</b></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Trongate Choose The Difficult Path</h3>
	<p>Instead of cosying up to third-party providers, the makers of Trongate choose a far more difficult path.  We did the unthinkable and we wrote our own libraries!  This includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A compete eco-system of JavaScript components</li>
		<li>A minimalist CSS framework</li>
		<li>A code sharing eco-system</li>
		<li>A graphical query builder</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Having our own libraries means that Trongate developers can sleep comfortably at night, knowing that they're not going to wake up to the news that all their precious work has suddenly become obsolete - all because of somebody else's rewrite schedule!</p>
	<h2>Are the Trongate Libraries Any Good?</h2>
	<p>From date-pickers to sophisticated API managers... Trongate has it all!</p>
	<p>You may wonder, "Are all of these assets that make up the Trongate eco-system any good?".</p>
	<p>We put that to the test by comparing Trongate's multi-file uploader with the other two most popular file uploaders in the world.  Take a look at what happened:</p>
