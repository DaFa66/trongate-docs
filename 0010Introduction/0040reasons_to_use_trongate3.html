    <h1>Reasons to Use Trongate</h1>
    <h2>Reason #3: No Third-Party Dependencies</h2>
    <p>While integrating third-party code can offer benefits, relying on third-party code can introduce challenges such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Being forced to adhere to someone else's rewrite schedule.</li>
        <li>Inheriting security vulnerabilities of external libraries.</li>
        <li>Aligning with the vision of external library maintainers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>We Did The Unthinkable!</h3>
    <p>Instead of cozying up to third-party providers, the makers of Trongate choose a different path. We wrote our own libraries! This includes but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A complete eco-system of JavaScript components</li>
        <li>A minimalist CSS framework</li>
        <li>A code-sharing ecosystem</li>
        <li>A graphical query builder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These assets empower us to provide unparalleled stability while affording precise control over functionality and performance. The result? A seamlessly integrated ecosystem renowned for its performance, stability, and user-friendly nature.</p>
