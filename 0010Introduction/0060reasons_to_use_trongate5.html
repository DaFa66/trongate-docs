<h1>Reasons to Use Trongate</h1>
<h2>Reason #5: It's Easy!</h2>
<p>As stated on the previous page, Trongate favors pure PHP over third-party dependencies. This results in a syntax and architecture that are simple and robust.</p>
<p>However, we've gone even further by producing a best-in-class code generator called 'The Trongate Desktop App'.</p>
<p>With the Trongate Desktop App, developers can easily build large-scale, database-driven applications in a remarkably short period of time. In addition to providing developers with a beautiful code generator, we've also added a graphical query builder to help developers simplify complex table joins.</p>
<p>All of this is available for free and is fully open source.</p>
