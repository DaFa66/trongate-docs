<h1>The 'Get Where Custom' Method<br></h1>
<p>The 'Get Where Custom' method is for fetching rows of data from a database table. It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>$column</strong> (required) - the name of the table column referred to when results are fetched.</li>
    <li><strong>$value</strong> (required) - the value that should be matched against the target table column.</li>
    <li><strong>$operator</strong> (optional) - the comparison operator that will be used to fetch records. By default this is set to the equals symbol ('=').</li>
    <li><strong>$order_by</strong> (optional) - the name of the table column by which results should be ordered. In instances where you'd like your results to be displayed in descending order, add the characters ' desc' onto your order by argument. By default, the Model will order results by 'id'.</li>
    <li><strong>$target_table</strong> (optional) - the name of the database table to be queried. By default, the Model will assume the target table to be equal to the value on the first URL segment.</li>
    <li><strong>$limit</strong> (optional) - the maximum number of results that you would like to return. By default, the Model will assume no limit.</li>
    <li><strong>$offset</strong> (optional) - the number of rows to skip before fetching results.  </li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-warning">The starting point for a database results set is always assumed to have an offset of 0.</div>
</p>
<h2>What Gets Returned?</h2>
<p><strong>WHEN MATCHING RECORDS ARE FOUND</strong></p>
<p>If matching records are found then a PHP array will be returned where each item on the array represents a row from a database table. Each row, within the array, will be a PHP object.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN MATCHING RECORDS ARE NOT FOUND</strong></p>
<p>If the query fails to find any matching records then an empty array will be returned.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">Use PHP's inbuilt var_dump() method whenever you need to clarify the variable types from a given results set.</div>
</p>
<h2>Example 1<br></h2>
<p>The syntax below shows the simplest Get Where Custom example possible. In this example, we are passing in a column name of 'first_name' and a value of 'Bruce'.</p>
<p><pre><code>
$rows = $this-&gt;model-&gt;get_where_custom("first_name", "Bruce");
</code></pre></p>
<p>The code above will produce the following SQL query:</p>
<p><strong>SELECT * from </strong> <em><strong>tablename</strong></em><strong> WHERE first_name = 'Bruce' order by id</strong></p>
<p>Below is an example of a Members.php controller file that contains a test() method. Here we're invoking a basic 'Get' command and then immediately displaying the results using Trongate's json() method:</p>
<p><pre><code>
&lt;?php
class Members extends Trongate {

  function test() {
    $rows = $this-&gt;model-&gt;get_where_custom("first_name", "Bruce");
    json($rows);
  }

</code></pre></p>
<p>Below shows an example of the kind of output that we can expect to see from the above method, when Debug Mode is switched on:</p>

<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>Below is a more advanced example:</p>
<p><pre><code>
$rows = $this-&gt;model-&gt;get_where_custom("trongate_user_id", 88, "&gt;", "id desc", "members", "99", 1);
</code></pre></p>
<p>The code above would produce the following SQL query:</p>
<p><pre><code>SELECT * FROM members where trongate_user_id &gt; 88 order by id desc LIMIT 1, 99</code></pre></p>
