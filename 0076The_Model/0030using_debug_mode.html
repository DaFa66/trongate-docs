<h1>Using Debug Mode<br></h1>
<p>Trongate's Model class has the ability to be set to 'Debug Mode'. When Debug Mode is activated, it gives the developer an opportunity to view the raw SQL queries that are being produced by your app. To set your Model to debug mode, open up <strong>Model.php</strong>. Near the top of the file, you should see a private variable named $debug. By default, this will be set to the value of <em>false</em>. Simply change this value to <em>true</em> and Debug Mode will be enabled. For example:</p>
<p><pre><code>
private $debug = true;
</code></pre></p>
<div class="alert alert-info">PDO does not have the ability to fetch previously executed queries. Therefore, strictly speaking, 'Debug Mode' makes Trongate display the database queries that your app is <em>going to</em> produce.</div>
