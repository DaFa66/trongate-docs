<h1>How Trongate Works With Databases<br></h1>
<p>Trongate comes with a fully featured class for assisting with database interaction. The class is called 'Model' and is stored on a file, inside the engine directory, named <strong>Model.php</strong>.</p>
<p>The Model class contains the following methods:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Get</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Get Where</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Get Where Custom</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Get One Where</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Get Many Where</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Count</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Count Where</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Count Rows</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Get Max</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Insert</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Update</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Query</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Query Bind</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Insert Batch</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-success">When you're working with the Model, get comfortable with the idea of opening up Model.php and having a quick look at the methods to find out how they work and what arguments they might accept.</div>
</p>
<h2>Coming Up<br></h2>
<p>We're going to explore each of the methods above, but first - let's consider how to get set up and also how to view the SQL queries that are generated when we use the Model.</p>
