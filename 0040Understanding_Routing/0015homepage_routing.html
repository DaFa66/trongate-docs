<h1>Homepage Routing</h1>
<p>Routing plays a crucial role in defining the code that gets called whenever a user accesses the homepage of a website. Trongate's routing system maps the root URL, typically the homepage, to a specific module and controller that serves as the entry point for the application.</p>

<p>In Trongate, routing to the homepage is configured through settings, defined within the <code>config.php</code> file.  This configuration file is the main configuration file for Trongate and it is located within the 'config' directory. These settings specify which module, controller, and method are invoked when the homepage (represented, in code, by the <code><b>BASE_URL</b></code> constant) receives an HTTP GET request.</p>

<h2>Default Homepage Routing Configuration</h2>
<p>The code sample below (taken from <code>config.php</code>) shows the default constants that are used when a website visitor acccesses the homepage of a Trongate application:</p>
<pre><code>
define('DEFAULT_MODULE', 'welcome');
define('DEFAULT_CONTROLLER', 'Welcome');
define('DEFAULT_METHOD', 'index');
</code></pre>
<p>Each constant has a specific role in the application's entry point configuration:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DEFAULT_MODULE</strong>: Specifies the primary module to be loaded. This module houses the controllers and views essential for the application's operation.</li>
    <li><strong>DEFAULT_CONTROLLER</strong>: Identifies the controller class that will be instantiated within the chosen module, managing the application's business logic.</li>
    <li><strong>DEFAULT_METHOD</strong>: Indicates the initial method within the controller that will be executed, directing the application's initial response.</li>
</ul>

<p>With Trongate's default configuration settings, accessing the <code>BASE_URL</code> triggers the 'welcome' module, loading a 'Welcome' controller file that is located <i>inside</i> the 'welcome' module.  Thereafter, an 'index' method - which is part of the containing 'Welcome' class - is immediately invoked.</p>

<h2>Customizing Homepage Routing</h2>
<p>To customize homepage routing, modify the respective constants in the <code>config.php</code> file as required.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>
define('DEFAULT_MODULE', 'dashboard');
define('DEFAULT_CONTROLLER', 'Dashboard');
define('DEFAULT_METHOD', 'index');
</code></pre>
<p>The adjustments shown above would ensure that visiting the <code>BASE_URL</code> now loads the 'index' method within the 'Dashboard' controller of a hypothetical 'dashboard' module, effectively altering the initial user experience.</p>

    <p>It's important to verify that the specified module, controller, and method are correctly implemented to prevent errors during homepage access.</p>
