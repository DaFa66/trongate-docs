<h1>How Basic URL Routing Works<br></h1>
<p>Imagine you've been hired to build a database driven web app for a chess club. Let's assume that the URL for invoking (displaying) a particular member's profile page takes the following form:</p>
<p><strong>example.com/members/profile/88</strong></p>
<p>With Trongate's basic URL routing, the URL above would:</p>
<li>load the 'members' module</li>
<li>load the 'members' class from within the module</li>
<li>invoke the 'profile' method</li>
<li>pass the number <strong>88</strong> into the method, as an argument</li>
<h2>The Rules (for basic routing)</h2>
<p>As you can see, Trongate follows a simple set of rules for mapping a URL to a particular module and method. The rules for basic URL routing are:</p>
<li>assume the first URL segment to be the name of the module and class to be loaded</li>
<li>assume the second URL segment to be the name of the method that is to be invoked</li>
<li>assume the third segment (if there is one) to be the value that is to be passed into the method</li>
