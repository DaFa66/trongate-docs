<h1>Routing: An Overview</h1>
<p>Routing refers to the process of mapping Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs, to specific <strong>modules</strong>, <strong>controllers</strong>, and <strong>methods</strong> within the Trongate framework.</p>
<p>Trongate adopts a segment-based URL routing approach. This strategy promotes the creation of user-friendly and search engine optimized URLs, contrasting with traditional methodologies that often utilize query strings characterized by symbols such as question marks and equals signs.</p>
<h2>Routing Example</h2>
<p>Consider a scenario where an e-commerce website is being developed to sell laptops. On a website that is built using traditional PHP, a typical product page URL might be constructed like so:</p>
<pre><code>
https://example.com/store_items.php?id=35
</code></pre>
<p>Trongateâ€™s URL routing system allows for more readable URLs.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>
https://example.com/<mark>lenovo-thinkpad</mark>
</code></pre>
<p>URL routing not only enhances readability of URLs for users - it may also be benificial for search engine optimization puroposes.</p>
<p>This chapter explores the fundamentals of URL routing with Trongate - including; automatic routing, homepage routing and advanced custom URL routing.</p>
