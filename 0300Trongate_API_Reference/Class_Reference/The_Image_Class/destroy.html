  <h2>Description</h2>
  <div class="description">
    <p>This method frees up the memory allocated to the image resource that is currently loaded within the instance. It should be invoked when the image is no longer needed, especially in scripts that process multiple or large images, to prevent memory leaks and manage system resources efficiently. Failure to call this method in such scenarios can lead to increased memory usage and possible performance degradation.</p>
