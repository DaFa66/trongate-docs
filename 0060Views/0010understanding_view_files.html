<h1>Understanding View FIles</h1>
<p>View files are files that contain <em>presentation code</em> - such as HTML code (though sometimes other types of code such as JavaScript and/or CSS).  The normal practice, when using Trongate, is to have a folder called 'views' inside each of your modules.</p>

<p> <em>Views</em> folders exist at the same directory level as 'controllers' directories, however, strictly speaking - views directories are optional.  In other words, sometimes you may have modules that contain no HTML whatsoever.  An example of such a module might be a 'Paypal' module that is designed to receive payment information from Paypal.</p>
<h2>How View Files Work</h2>
<p>View files usually get called from controller files.  In the Trongate Framework, view files are always .php files - however - the code within the .php files is mostly presentation code such as HTML.</p>
<p>View files can be called (loaded) from within controller methods by loading up Trongate's inbuilt 'view' function.  For example:</p>
<p><pre><code>$this-&gt;view("welcome");</code></pre></p>
<p>The line of code above would be called from inside a method, within a Trongate controller class. By invoking Trongate's inbuilt view() method, the framework would attempt to display a file (stored within the views folder) named welcome.php.</p>
