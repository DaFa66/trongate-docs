<h1>Template Partials<br></h1>
<div class="alert alert-warning">What you're about to read here is entirely optional. It's perfectly acceptable to <em>not</em> use partials inside your templates.</div>
</p>
<h2>What Are Partials?</h2>
<p>Some developers like to break their page templates up into <em>partials</em> (sometimes referred to as 'components'). A partial is a section of code that is usually associated with a particular section or function, within a greater page template. Examples of partials could be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a header</li>
    <li>a footer</li>
    <li>a login area</li>
    <li>a top navigation bar</li>
</ul>
<h2>So, you wanna use partials huh?</h2>
<p>Using partials is as simple as saving a view file inside your partials directory and using Trongate's in-built 'Partial' method to load your partial. For example,</p>
<p><pre><code>
&lt;?= Template::partial("partials/footer") ?&gt;
</code></pre></p>
<p>As you would expect, partials can receive, display and manipulate data that has been passed in from your calling module. This can be easily achieved by passing in a $data array as an argument. For example,</p>
<p><pre><code>
&lt;?= Template::partial("partials/footer", $data) ?&gt;
</code></pre></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">The 'partials' directory is to be found inside 'templates/views'. Strictly speaking, you do not <em>need</em> to store partials inside the partials directory. Simply declaring the path as 'footer' would work and would attempt to load a view file from your 'views' directory within your 'template' module.</div>
</p>
<p>Below is an example of a template that does <em>not</em> use any partials:</p>
<p><img src="../images/94/without_yXnM.png" alt="no partials to be found here"></p>
<p>Here's the <em>same</em> template but with the <em>footer</em> now being called as a partial:</p>
<p><img src="../images/94/with_parvKes.png" alt="this template will attempt to load a partial called footer.php"></p>
