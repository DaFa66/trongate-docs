<h1>What Is A Controller?</h1>
<p>A 'controller' is a file that contains business logic.  In the case of the Trongate Framework, this means a PHP file that contains some sort of code for <em>controlling</em> how the application works.</p>
<p>Consider the structure of a module.</p>
<p><img src="../images/28/trongate6SeV.png" alt="a Trongate module"></p>
<p>All of the modules inside a Trongate app will contain a directory called 'controllers'.  Normally (though not always) the <em>controllers</em> directory will contain one PHP file.  This PHP file will be the <em>controller</em> for the module.  You can think of the controller as being the brains of the module.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<p>Below are some features that <em>all</em> Trongate controller files have in common:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Controller files always share the same name as the module that they belong to.</li>
    <li>Controller file names always have an uppercase first character.</li>
    <li>Controller files always contain a class that extends the main 'Trongate' class.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-warning">This documentation (and the Trongate Desktop App) favours pluralised names for both modules and controller files.  However, this is not enforced.  <strong>You are welcome to use either singular or pluralised names as you please.</strong>   Also, this documentation (and the Trongate Desktop App) favours <strong>snake_case</strong> for module names, PHP file names and function/method names.  Again, this decision is not enforced.</div>
