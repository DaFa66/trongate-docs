<h1>The Structure Of A Controller<br></h1>
<p>Below is an example of a basic Trongate controller file called 'Dice'.</p>
<p><pre><code>
&lt;?php
class Dice extends Trongate {

  function roll() {
    $number = rand(1, 6);
    echo $number;
  }

}
</code></pre></p>
<p>The controller would be named 'Dice.php' and would exist inside a module named 'dice'.</p>
<p>As you can see, the Dice controller contains a PHP class that extends the (inbuilt) 'Trongate' class. The Trongate class is a class inside the 'engine' folder. Extending the Trongate class gives the Dice controller the power to access all of Trongate's hidden goodies like; form validation, a URL helper and much more.</p>
<p>The Dice controller contains one method (a function inside a class). The name of the method is 'roll'.</p>
<p>The roll() method can be invoked by going to your main website URL followed by 'dice/roll'. For example:</p>
<p><pre><code>
yoursite.com/dice/roll
</code></pre></p>
<p>The roll method generates a random number between one and six - using PHP's inbuilt rand() function. Then, the random number that has been generated is displayed on the screen.</p>

    Remember to:</p>
    <li>Always start your controller file name with a capital letter</li>
    <li>Always start your controller class names with a capital letter</li>
    <li>Always give your (main) controller class the same name as the module where it resides (keeping in mind that the module name can be all lowercase)</li>
</div>
