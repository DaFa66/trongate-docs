<h1>Using Packagist With Trongate</h1>

<p>This guide outlines the process for integrating third-party PHP libraries into Trongate applications using <a href="https://packagist.org/" target="_blank">Packagist</a>, the primary repository for Composer packages. For demonstration purposes, the instructions below specifically focus on downloading and utilizing Guzzle. <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/guzzlehttp/guzzle">Guzzle</a> is a PHP library that facilitates the sending and receiving of HTTP requests and responses.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>Before you start, make sure your system meets the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>PHP:</strong> PHP 8 or newer is required to use the latest version of Trongate with Packagist.</li>
    <li class="mt-1"><strong>Composer:</strong> Composer must be installed on your system for managing library dependencies. If Composer is not installed, visit <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">getcomposer.org</a> to download and install it.</li>
    <li class="mt-1"><strong>Internet Connection:</strong> An active internet connection is necessary to download packages from Packagist.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mt-3">Step 1: Setting Up Your Project with Composer</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Initialize Composer:</strong> If you don't already have a <code>composer.json</code> file in your project, you can create one by running the following command in your project directory:
        <pre><code>composer init</code></pre>
        Follow the prompts to configure your project. This setup helps manage your project dependencies.</li>
    <li class="mt-1"><strong>Install Guzzle:</strong> Add Guzzle to your project by running:
        <pre><code>composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle</code></pre>
        This command tells Composer to find Guzzle on Packagist and install it along with any necessary dependencies.</li>
    <li class="mt-1"><strong>Verify Installation:</strong> Ensure that the Guzzle library has been added to your project by checking that your <code>composer.json</code> file includes Guzzle and that the <code>vendor</code> directory has been created with Guzzle files in it.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="mt-3">Step 2: Using Guzzle in Your Trongate Application</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Autoload Dependencies:</strong> To use Guzzle, you need to include Composer's autoloader in your PHP script. Add the following line at the top of your PHP file:
        <pre><code>require '../vendor/autoload.php';</code></pre>
        This inclusion ensures that all dependencies, including Guzzle, are loaded and available for use.</li>
    <li class="mt-1"><strong>Create an HTTP Client:</strong> Instantiate a new Guzzle client to make HTTP requests:
        <pre><code>$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();</code></pre></li>
    <li class="mt-1"><strong>Make an HTTP Request:</strong> Use the client to send a request and retrieve the response:
        <pre><code>$response = $client->request('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data');
echo $response->getBody();</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h2>Complete Example:</h2>
<p>Below is an example of using Guzzle being used, within a Trongate controller file, to fetch user data from GitHubâ€™s API:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;?php
require '../vendor/autoload.php';

use GuzzleHttp\Client;

class Welcome extends Trongate {

    function fetch() {

        $client = new Client();
        try {
            $response = $client->request('GET', 'https://api.github.com/users/trongate');
            $data = json_decode($response->getBody(), true);
            echo "GitHub User: " . $data['login'] . " has " . $data['followers'] . " followers.";
        } catch (GuzzleHttp\Exception\GuzzleException $e) {
            echo 'Request failed: ' . $e->getMessage();
        }

    }

}
</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>For simplicity, the example above uses <code>require '../vendor/autoload.php';</code> to load the Guzzle library along with any other potential Composer dependencies. While <code>require</code> is utilized in this instance, it is advisable to use <code>require_once</code> in scenarios where the same file might be included multiple times within an application. This approach prevents errors such as redeclaration of classes or functions and ensures that the file is included only once, safeguarding the application's stability.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it should be noted that Trongate controllers have access to an <code>APPPATH</code> constant. This constant references the application's root directory, providing a reliable method to specify file paths. Instead of using a relative path, <code>APPPATH</code> can be employed to ensure that the file path is always correctly resolved, regardless of where the script is executed within the application structure. Therefore, the autoload include statement used in the example above could be modified to:</p>
   <p><code>require_once APPPATH.'vendor/autoload.php';</code></p>
</div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even though Trongate has its own <a href="https://trongate.io/module-market" target="_blank">code-sharing platform</a>, there could be instances where downloading of third-party code via Packagist may be beneficial. Packagist offers a vast repository of PHP libraries and packages that can significantly accelerate development and bring advanced functionality to your projects with minimal effort.</p>
<p>However, the use of Packagist is not without its challenges. Relying on Packagist can lead to potential issues with stability, versioning, and dependencies. Moreover, developers considering using code from Packagist should be cognizant of potential <a href="https://news.google.com/search?q=Packagist" target="_blank">security vulnerabilities</a> associated with Packagist.</p>
<p>The Trongate framework enables developers to selectively use Packagist for specific modules, providing precise integration without compromising the overall performance of the application. This targeted approach ensures that enhancements can be made where necessary without affecting the efficiency of the entire system.</p>
